# About this site

This site is built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for building full stack web applications. Most of the content is written in markdown, and rendered into HTML using [Remark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark). 

## Purpose

This site serves two main purposes: to showcase things I do, and to be a space to write about things online. In the latter case, the audience is primarily myself. The nature of this site is that it is always a work in progress, things may not be fully polished, but I hope you enjoy your time here.

## Todo List
- Enable switching between light and dark theme.
- Add an area for public obsidian notes. See [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
